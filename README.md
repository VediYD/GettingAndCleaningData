##This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The data set being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

* `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that were performed to clean the given data.
* `run_analysis.R` contains the entire code necessary to perform the analyses described in the CodeBook.
* `Tidy.txt` is the required tidy data set.
